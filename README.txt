This is my currently in development website. Feel free to use it as a (horrible) reference for learning HTML, CSS, or whatever else I decide to shove into it.

This page has been in development for a while but the most recent developments have been in progress since July 28, 2014 and are still being pumped out regularly.

contact pkjohnson2012@hotmail.com or @probably_parker on twitter for more info.
